== Bootstrap scss guides==

=> when adding bootstrap via scss method then we are already aware that we have to override bootstrap variables in scss by importing our own variables first and 
then importing bootstrap variables

=> but in case of when it is needed to exten bootstrap utility, a very specific order is necessary because if you don't follow that order then error might occur.

=> Added files here will show the specific case for overriding variables and utilities.

here there are three files - 

main.scss- which is main file off scss where everything else has been imported
_variables.scss - this is variable overrides for bootstrap as well as new custom variables, this has been imported before bootstrao variables to override them.
_custom_bs_utilities - this file goes after importing bootstrap amd codebase(installed theme's) utilities but before importing bootstrao itself 
    becausse bootstrap starts using utilities when we import them into it.

i.e. like this,

// Bootstrap Utilities
@import "bootstrap/utilities";

// Custom utilities and Bootstrap overrides
@import "codebase/utilities";
@import "custom/utility/custom_bs_utilities"; /// this is my file for customizing bootstrap utilities

// Bootstrap components (original)
