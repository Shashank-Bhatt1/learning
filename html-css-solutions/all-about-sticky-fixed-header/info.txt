- CSS position sticky has two main parts, sticky item & sticky container.


Sticky Item — is the element that we defined with the position: sticky styles. The element will float when the viewport position matches the position definition, for example: top: 0px .


.some-component{
    position: sticky;
    top: 0px;
}

Sticky Container —is the HTML element which wraps the sticky item. This is the maximum area that the sticky item can float in.



When you define an element with position: sticky you’re automatically defining the parent element as a sticky container!
This is very important to remember! The container is the scope of the sticky item, and the item can’t get out of its sticky container.


==Important note====

1. When the sticky item is the only child element in a sticky container, it will not stick.

2. When header is sticky element with top:0 and you need gap(offset) for all other children from header then use scroll-padding-top property on html and body element.



html, body {
    height: 100%;
    scroll-padding-top: 150px; //assuming the height of header is 150px
}

with the above code, when we use internal link hashid in the page, all page hashes will take the offset into account and jump to 150px below the page top.
