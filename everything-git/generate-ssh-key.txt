=====generate ssh key gen in system======

Default location for key generation is /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa(private key) and /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub(public key)

=>step-1

ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/odoo/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/odoo/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/odoo/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:Ld+O1cJS7xBTWHqm6vW0sjmiJoQbG4Cj0SsrHEEKHFE odoo@odoo-HP-ProDesk-600-G1-SFF
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|.o+E          .  |
|.o           +   |
|+o          o +  |
|=.o      .   =   |
|.o.o .  S . =    |
|o.. + .  o = =   |
|.o.  *    + B +  |
|o.  o . ...*oB . |
|.      o..o.+++  |
+----[SHA256]-----+


side notes

We recommend keeping the default key name unless you have a reason to change it. To create a key with a non-default name or path, specify the full path to the key. For example, to create a key called my-new-ssh-key, enter the Windows path, shown here:
$ ssh-keygen 
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/emmap1/.ssh/id_rsa): c:\Users\emmap1\.ssh\my-new-ssh-key     


=>step-2

1. Add the key to the ssh-agent
eval $(ssh-agent) 

2.Enter ssh-add followed by the path to the private key file:
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/<private_key_file>

=>step-3

From Bitbucket, choose Personal settings from your avatar in the lower left.

Click SSH keys.
If you've already added keys, you'll see them on this page.

In your terminal window, copy the contents of your public key file. If you renamed the key, replace id_rsa.pub with the public key file name.

On Linux, you can cat the contents:

$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub      

On macOS, the following command copies the output to the clipboard:

$ pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub      

Select and copy the key output in the clipboard.
If you have problems with copy and paste, you can open the file directly with Notepad. Select the contents of the file (just avoid selecting the end-of-file characters).

From Bitbucket, click Add key.

Enter a Label for your new key, for example, Default public key.

Paste the copied public key into the SSH Key field.
You may see an email address on the last line when you paste. It doesn't matter whether or not you include the email address in the Key.

Click Save.
Bitbucket sends you an email to confirm the addition of the key.

Return to the terminal window and verify your configuration and username by entering the following command:

$ ssh -T git@bitbucket.org
