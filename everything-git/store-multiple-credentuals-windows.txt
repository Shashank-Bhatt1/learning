In case you need to have multiple accounts in windows credentials manager, follow these steps

-> First you need to set your user name and email locally for this project only so that it doesn't affect system username and email

Run these commands from local cloned repo.

git config --local user.name <your_github_username>

git config --local user.name <your_github_email>

-> Second, you might probably not allowed to push even after setting correct user name and email due to earlier different credentuals username in git credentials manageer.

your credentials username should be set as per your username to store it as credentials. 

git config --global user.name ""
