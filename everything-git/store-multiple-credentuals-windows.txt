In case you need to have multiple accounts in windows credentials manager, follow these steps

-> First you need to set your user name and email locally for this project only so that it doesn't affect system username and email

Run these commands from local cloned repo.

git config --local user.name <your_github_username>

git config --local user.name <your_github_email>

-> Second, you might probably not allowed to push even after setting correct user name and email due to earlier different credentials username in git credentials manageer.

your credentials' username should be set as per your username to store it as credentials. 

git config --local credential.username "your_github_username"

-> And after you store credentials.username as a git config, git credentails manageer will open up a new popup when trying push. Add your username and password or login with codebase

-> After you login, new entry with your credentials will be added in git credentails manager and you will be able to push to your different repo.
