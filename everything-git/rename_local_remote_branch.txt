==== renaming git local/remote branch=====

=>rename local if in same branch

git branch -m new-name

if not in same branch then from other branch

git branch -m old-name new-name



=>Delete branch of old name from remote repo

git push origin --delete old-name


=>Finally, push the branch with the correct name, and reset the upstream branch:

git push origin -u new-name


=>Alternatively, you can overwrite the remote branch with a single command: 
(this command delete old one and pushes new one with new name but still below mentioned resetting the upstream command is required)

git push origin :old-name new-name


=>Resetting the upstream branch is still required:
git push origin -u new-name
